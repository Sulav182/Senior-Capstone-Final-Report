# Senior-Capstone-Final-Report
Final report of the senior capstone project.
For our final project we decided to play around with raspberry pi. Seeing how many people were complaining about parking on campus, we decided to build our project around that.
We decided on building an application called Parksmart that would indicate if there is a free parking space in a parking lot. We used ultrasonic sensor to check if there is a car at a parking lot and then update the application, which could be accessed via android phone. More details can be found in the report.
